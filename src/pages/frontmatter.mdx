# Frontmatter & Exports

MDX supports two ways to attach metadata: YAML frontmatter and named exports.

## YAML Frontmatter

```mdx
---
title: Getting Started
description: Learn the basics
author: Jane Doe
date: 2026-01-01
tags: [mdx, docs]
draft: false
---

# Getting Started
```

## Named Exports

Named exports let you expose typed JavaScript values from an MDX file.

```mdx
export const meta = {
  readTime: "8 min",
  difficulty: "intermediate",
}

Read time: {meta.readTime}

// Import from another file
import { meta } from './page.mdx'
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Frontmatter is not automatically available as a JavaScript variable. Use
  `remark-frontmatter` + `remark-mdx-frontmatter` to expose it as an export.
</Callout>
