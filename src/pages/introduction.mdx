# Introduction to MDX

<Callout type="info">
  MDX is an authorable format that lets you use JSX in your Markdown content.
  Import interactive charts, alerts, or any React component and embed them
  within your content.
</Callout>

MDX is a superset of Markdown — everything you know still works. The key
difference is that you can import and use React components directly inside
your `.mdx` files.

## Why MDX?

Traditional Markdown is great for static content but falls short when you
need interactivity. MDX bridges this gap by letting you embed fully-functional
React components alongside your prose.

## How it works

MDX files are compiled by a bundler plugin at build time. The compiler
transforms your `.mdx` file into a React component you can import and render
like any other component — zero runtime overhead.

```bash
npm install @mdx-js/react @mdx-js/rollup
```
