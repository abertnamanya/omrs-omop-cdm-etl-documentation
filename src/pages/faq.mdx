# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is MDX the same as Markdown?

MDX is a superset of Markdown. All valid Markdown is valid MDX, but MDX adds
JSX support on top.

## Do I need React to use MDX?

MDX is React-focused by default, but integrations exist for Preact, Vue
(via Astro), and Svelte.

## Can I use MDX with Next.js?

Yes! Install `@next/mdx` and configure `next.config.js`. MDX pages are fully
supported in both the App Router and Pages Router.

## Is MDX good for performance?

Yes. MDX compiles to static React components at build time — there is no
runtime parsing overhead in production.

## Can I use hooks inside MDX?

Yes, you can define and use React hooks in MDX. However, it's better practice
to extract complex logic into a dedicated component file.
